I tried to emulate the landing page of a local restaurant, casalupu.ro      
I focused only on the navbar which I find the most interesting part.   
I did it mobile first, fluid and responsive. I used a "sticky" navbar as well.   
The overlay menu can be closed by click on the main page as well.
I used HTML, CSS and Javascript and elements from the original page.
